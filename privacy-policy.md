# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy explains how the extension handles your data.

## Data Collection

We do not collect personal data. The only data stored is your API key, which is needed to generate commit messages.

## Data Usage

The API key is used solely to generate commit messages via the API. We do not store or transmit your key beyond what is necessary to make the API request.

## Data Storage

Your API key is stored locally in your browser’s storage. It is only accessible by the extension and is not shared with any third parties.

## Third-Party Services

The extension interacts with an external API to generate commit messages. The privacy policy of that service governs how your API key is handled when making requests.

## User Responsibility

Users are responsible for securing and managing their own API keys. By using this extension, users agree to safeguard their keys and take appropriate actions to prevent unauthorized access. The developer does not have access to your API key, and it is stored securely in your browser’s local storage.

## Changes

This privacy policy may be updated occasionally. Please check for updates periodically.

## Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability

By using this extension, you acknowledge that the developer is not responsible for any data loss, breaches, misuse, or any other unintended consequences that may result from using this extension. You are solely responsible for managing your API key, ensuring its security, and understanding the potential risks. The extension is provided "as is" without any warranties, express or implied, and the developer is not liable for any issues arising from its use. You use this extension at your own risk.

## Security Measures

We take reasonable precautions to store your API key securely in your browser’s local storage. However, no system is 100% secure, and you acknowledge that you are responsible for managing the security of your API key.
